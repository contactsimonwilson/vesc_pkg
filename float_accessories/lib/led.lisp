; LED control over the esp_led_strip native lib. The lib owns the framebuffers,
; render thread and driver; this module runs the state machine (direction, idle,
; mall grab, brake light, charging) and sets per-segment appearance through the
; ext-esp_led-* extensions. Strips sharing a pin are chained by offset.
;
; A strip's timing config doubles as its enable: 0 = disabled, 1+ = preset + 1.
; Highbeam mode 1 drives a PWM pin, mode 2 drives LEDs embedded in the strip as
; overlay pixels, at the positions packed one per byte in highbeam-pos, mapped
; onto the configured min-max drive range.

; Every LED setting, copied into the RAM cache the loop reads. Each name is both
; the config key and the variable it lands in, so this is a list and a loop rather
; than 55 assignments that could drift. Quoted, so the list lives in the const
; heap. Adding one: put the key here, declare the variable in led-vars.lisp.
