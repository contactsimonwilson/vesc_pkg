; LED state. Rendering is done by the esp_led_strip native lib; this module
; only keeps the configuration cache and the state-machine variables the
; LED loop uses to drive it.

; esp_led effect / palette / type / timing / turn-mode ids are defined once in
; the esp_led_strip library (../lib_esp_led_strip/esp_led_defs.lisp) and imported
; by float_accessories.lisp before this module, so they cannot drift from the
; lib's C enums.
